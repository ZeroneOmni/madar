# Release packaging constraints

Use the [Madar release runbook](./madar.md) for release triggers, targets, and credentials. The sections below retain backend update and desktop packaging constraints.

## Server self-update release invariant

Servers that update themselves download the target version's CLI archive from the GitHub Release. Every released client version must have its CLI archives and `SHA256SUMS` available before users can receive that client. Desktop auto-update also reads the GitHub Release directly. Madar does not publish an npm launcher or deploy a hosted web client.

For a release smoke test, verify that the target CLI archive is available and its checksum matches `SHA256SUMS`. Exercise the retained backend's update path from the previous version and verify that it reconnects at the target version. When the release adds database migrations, verify that the update applies them. A failed trial must restore the database snapshot and restart the previous server. If the installed launcher does not support the target protocol, verify that the update stops before restart.

## Desktop auto-update notes

- Updater runtime: `apps/desktop/src/updates/DesktopUpdates.ts`.
- `electron-updater` adapter: `apps/desktop/src/electron/ElectronUpdater.ts`.
- `apps/desktop/src/main.ts` only wires the updater layers into the desktop runtime.
- Update UX:
  - Background checks run on startup delay + interval.
  - No automatic download or install.
  - The desktop UI shows a rocket update button when an update is available; click once to download, click again after download to restart/install.
- Provider: GitHub Releases (`provider: github`) configured at build time.
- Repository slug source:
  - `MADAR_DESKTOP_UPDATE_REPOSITORY` (format `owner/repo`), if set.
  - otherwise `GITHUB_REPOSITORY` from GitHub Actions.
- Required release assets for updater:
  - platform installers (`.exe`, `.dmg`, `.AppImage`, `.deb`, plus macOS `.zip` for Squirrel.Mac update payloads)
  - channel metadata: `latest*.yml` for stable releases, `nightly*.yml` for nightly releases
  - `*.blockmap` files (used for differential downloads)
- macOS metadata note:
  - `electron-updater` reads `latest-mac.yml` on stable and `nightly-mac.yml` on nightly, for both Intel and Apple Silicon.
  - The workflow merges the per-arch mac manifests into one channel-specific mac manifest before publishing the GitHub Release.

### Windows payload topology and update validation

Windows packages the bundled server and only its runtime-external/native
dependency closure in `resources/server.asar`. Native modules and helper
executables declared as unpacked by that archive must be present at the matching
paths below `resources/server.asar.unpacked`. The Windows-native backend reads
the archive in place through Electron.

Windows keeps JavaScript and package metadata inside `app.asar` and unpacks only
native libraries and helper executables. Avoid enabling whole-package smart
unpacking: each loose file adds work to NSIS installation and counts against
the payload limit.

The artifact builder rejects a Windows package when any of these invariants
break:

- `resources/server.asar` is absent or does not contain the server entry.
- Any file marked unpacked in the ASAR header is absent from
  `resources/server.asar.unpacked`.
- The isolated, extracted sidecar cannot load the server entry with plain Node.
- The external Windows resource monitor is absent.
- The unpacked Windows application contains more than 80 files.

Cross-architecture Windows builds retain every structural and extracted-sidecar
check, but skip executing the target Electron binary. A same-architecture build
for each release target must exercise the primary native-load probe.

NSIS differential packaging remains enabled. A sidecar layout transition can
produce a larger one-time download; subsequent small releases retain their
blockmaps, with a 60 MB maximum for a representative sidecar-to-sidecar update.

## 2) Apple signing + notarization setup (macOS)

Required secrets used by the workflow:

- `CSC_LINK`
- `CSC_KEY_PASSWORD`
- `APPLE_API_KEY`
- `APPLE_API_KEY_ID`
- `APPLE_API_ISSUER`

Checklist:

1. Create a `Developer ID Application` certificate in your Apple Developer account.
2. Export the certificate and private key as `.p12` from Keychain.
3. Base64-encode the `.p12` and store it as `CSC_LINK`.
4. Store the export password as `CSC_KEY_PASSWORD`.
5. In App Store Connect, create a Team API key.
6. Add its values as secrets:
   - `APPLE_API_KEY`: contents of the downloaded `.p8`
   - `APPLE_API_KEY_ID`: Key ID
   - `APPLE_API_ISSUER`: Issuer ID
7. Re-run a tag release and confirm that the macOS artifacts are signed and notarized.

The workflow writes `APPLE_API_KEY` to a temporary `AuthKey_<id>.p8` file at runtime.

## 3) Azure Trusted Signing setup (Windows)

Required secrets used by the workflow:

- `AZURE_TENANT_ID`
- `AZURE_CLIENT_ID`
- `AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET`
- `AZURE_TRUSTED_SIGNING_ENDPOINT`
- `AZURE_TRUSTED_SIGNING_ACCOUNT_NAME`
- `AZURE_TRUSTED_SIGNING_CERTIFICATE_PROFILE_NAME`
- `AZURE_TRUSTED_SIGNING_PUBLISHER_NAME`

Checklist:

1. Create Azure Trusted Signing account and certificate profile.
2. Record ATS values:
   - Endpoint
   - Account name
   - Certificate profile name
   - Publisher name
3. Create/choose an Entra app registration (service principal).
4. Grant service principal permissions required by Trusted Signing.
5. Create a client secret for the service principal.
6. Add Azure secrets listed above in GitHub Actions secrets.
7. Re-run a tag release and confirm Windows installer is signed.

## 5) Troubleshooting

- macOS build unsigned when expected signed:
  - Check all Apple secrets plus `APPLE_TEAM_ID` are populated and non-empty.
  - Confirm the provisioning profile belongs to `APPLE_TEAM_ID.com.madartools.madar` and includes
    Associated Domains.
- Windows build unsigned when expected signed:
  - Check all Azure ATS and auth secrets are populated and non-empty.
- Build fails with signing error:
  - Retry with secrets removed to confirm unsigned path still works.
  - Re-check certificate/profile names and tenant/client credentials.
