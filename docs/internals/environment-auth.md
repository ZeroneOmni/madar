# Environment authentication

The environment issues its own sessions and enforces their capabilities.

## Authority survives transport changes

Pairing delegates a set of scopes. Exchanging a bootstrap credential can narrow
that grant but cannot widen it. The default grant includes access management.
A narrower client gets explicit scopes. Creating another pairing link requires both `access:write` and
every scope being delegated. The
[auth handlers](../../apps/server/src/auth/http.ts) enforce this at issuance;
client labels and device metadata have no authorization role.

The access read model contains pairing metadata, never recoverable pairing
secrets. Only the creation response returns the raw credential. Otherwise read
access to the connections list would become a way to acquire another client's
authority.

Browser cookies, bearer tokens, and DPoP tokens adapt the same scoped session
model. DPoP binds a token to a client's proof key; an invalid proof must fail
rather than fall back to bearer authentication. The OAuth token-exchange
vocabulary gives these grants a familiar meaning.

Legacy sessions with subject `mcp-client` remain invalid for HTTP authentication.
The retired audience must not gain access to current APIs.

Scope changes must not prevent older clients from connecting. Token exchange
intersects recognized requests with the pairing grant; retired and unknown names
are dropped. A request with no granted scopes fails before consuming the link.
Stored credentials are never expanded when scopes split.

Auth responses expose the exact grant in both `scopes` and `permissions`.
Clients use `permissions` when present, even when empty. Stored credentials drop
retired or unknown scopes without expanding their remaining grants. New grant
inputs stay strict. Unknown response permissions are ignored.

Desktop restarts forget the previous local bearer token, so its reusable
bootstrap grant replaces earlier sessions for the same subject and method.
Revocation and insertion share a [database
transaction](../../apps/server/src/persistence/AuthSessions.ts); a failed
replacement must leave the old credential usable. Pairing and browser sessions
do not follow this replacement rule.

### Reusable dev credential

Web development environments can accept one `MADAR_DEV_AUTH_TOKEN` across
worktrees and ports on one hostname. The token and startup URLs that contain it
grant administrative access. Desktop and non-development servers ignore it. See
the [development runbook](../operations/development.md#reusable-dev-credential)
for setup.

Each environment hashes the value and seeds its own database record at startup.
Environments do not share SQLite data, signing keys, environment IDs, session
records, pairing grants, or revocation state. Local revocation persists after
restart and does not affect another worktree. Removing or rotating the value
and restarting invalidates the old credential.

Normal credentials keep precedence. A rejected normal credential never falls
back to the reusable credential. OAuth exchanges create ordinary local bearer
or DPoP children with normal expiry and revocation. The reusable cookie expires
after 30 days.
